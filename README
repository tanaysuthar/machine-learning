You will find two folders in this package:

1. datalake

Contains example data and a CloudFormation template + Makefile to create a simple Glue database you can use with Athena.

To deploy think of a S3 bucket name (it will be created by the CloudFormation template) and run:

BUCKET_NAME=... make deploy

To tear it down run

BUCKET_NAME=... make delete

2. code

This contains the code that needs to run, you will find a Jupyter notebook, an SQL query that will be loaded by the notebook and a script for sanity checking the output.
